# Visualizing the Vote – Tableau Dashboard Project

This project explores patterns in U.S. presidential elections using Tableau. I created an interactive dashboard to highlight how voting behavior, electoral trends, and candidate performance have shifted over time.

The goal was to turn a large dataset into something clear and compelling — not just for analysts, but for anyone curious about how our elections play out across states and decades.

##  Why This Project?
